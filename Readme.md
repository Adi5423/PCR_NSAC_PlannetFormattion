Disclamer: 
Following a brief miscommunication among our team members, our project scope has undergone a subtle shift. What initially began as “Building a Space Biology Knowledge Engine” has now evolved into “Create Your Own Challenge.”

[PPT Here](./PPT_Procedural_PlanetFormation_OriginSphere.pdf)

Create a 3d SRP project in unity.
and then clone these files folders.

## The Thing to test.
Just create a empty game object (Ctrl+Shift+N)
Drag and drop the Scripts/AdaptiveCubeSphere.cs script to the empty object 
Here u can make the changes in the 3d sphere and proceurally generate the sphere from algorithm only, the details of all the 6 faces can be just increased higher or lower , ex make the points more refine and by subdividing the specific face. (increasing the count from 16 as for that, more vertices to handle.)


## About the Project.
Also there are files of Noise Map generation for the planet's land and water type of data to fetch with a coordinate system likewise earth's axis also the latitude and longitude.
Although those code resulting some errors....but this is as the 1st development phase and this all as a prototype.
and also the basic texture gradient system for the heighs and lows generated by the noise map. 

# Implemented.
The Procedural 3D Mesh generation Works perfectly Fine.
just drag and drop the AdaptiveCubeSphere script file to a empty object and controll the 3dD mesh generated (Here Sphere)
